          <p class="fade-in">Hello there! I’m Radison, a creative leader, project manager, computer science student, and professional photographer. My interest in digital technology started back in middle school when I tinkered with microcontrollers and competed in FIRST LEGO League competitions — it turns out you can learn a lot from bits of plastic and expensive servos.</p>
          <p class="fade-in">Fast-forward to today, where I’ve had the privilege of working at a <NuxtLink class="text-secondary underline underline-offset-2" to="https://uic.edu">R1 research university</NuxtLink>, <NuxtLink class="text-secondary underline underline-offset-2" to="https://www.va.gov">a department of the U.S. government</NuxtLink>, <NuxtLink class="text-secondary underline underline-offset-2" href="https://www.stevenolikara.com">a U.S. Senate campaign</NuxtLink>, <NuxtLink class="text-secondary underline underline-offset-2" href="https://www.monteltech.com">a start-up</NuxtLink>, and <NuxtLink class="text-secondary underline underline-offset-2" href="https://my.lifetime.life/athletic-events.html">an event management group</NuxtLink>. Nowadays, you’ll find me relentlessly building and operationally leading <NuxtLink class="text-secondary underline underline-offset-2" href="https://pulqra.com">Pulqra</NuxtLink>, a creative marketing collective with over 200 collaborations worldwide.</p>
          <p class="fade-in">I’m also juggling quite a few responsibilities at the <NuxtLink class="text-secondary underline underline-offset-2" to="https://uic.edu">University of Illinois Chicago</NuxtLink>. For starters, I am studying computer science and business full-time (with a 4.0 GPA, whoop!). I also project manage 7 web and database developers working on over 10 full-stack web applications for the College of Engineering, part-time.</p>
          <p class="fade-in">Making an impact is part of my DNA, especially when it comes to personal projects. I recently gave <NuxtLink class="text-secondary underline underline-offset-2" to="https://youtu.be/cD53M7NHQoM">a 300-level guest lecture</NuxtLink> at UIC about <NuxtLink class="text-secondary underline underline-offset-2" to="https://chickens.rakerman.com">Exploding Chickens</NuxtLink> — a popular full-stack card game I built with my friends. We dove deep into project management, design patterns, code review, and test coverage.</p>
          <p class="fade-in">Huge projects like Exploding Chickens (built with over 30,000 lines of code!) necessitated an almost business-like structure to coordinate development. The RAkerman Foundation answered this call and now hosts over <NuxtLink class="text-secondary underline underline-offset-2" to="https://status.rakerman.com">12 web services</NuxtLink>, 2 web products generating revenue, and 5 organizational members.</p>
