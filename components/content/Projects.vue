                        Becoming an expert, scratch that, freakishly good at something takes years of trial and error
                        until you get it right.
                        Malcolm Gladwell in his book, Outliers: The Story of Success, says you need 10,000 hours (20
                        hours per week for 10 years) to be a phenom at some particular craft.

                        “The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to
                        achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert—in anything,” writes the
                        neurologist Daniel Levitin. — p. 40

                        Ever since I first discovered what computers are capable of in 7th grade, I've found an
                        unrelenting drive to learn and push things further.
                        Computer science became a part-time hobby for me (and still is) as I continue to build a
                        catalogue of personal projects.
