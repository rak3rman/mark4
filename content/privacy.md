We don't collect your data and use it to track you. Period.

# Privacy Policy

Throughout all services on rakerman.com, **none of them will collect your data and use it to track you as an individual**.
Rather, a few services may collect small amounts of anonymous, non-personal data needed to provide a key feature of the
service.
The data we collect is never related to anything about you â€“ meaning no cookies, no ad tracking, and no data to be
leaked in the first place.
All data collection methods require some specific action by you.
Simply visiting a site will not relinquish your data automatically to the service.
All data is stored on a secure, sand-boxed database, not sold or distributed to external parties, nor linked to you or
your browser.

**In a nutshell:** Data used to track you: none.
Data linked to you: none.
Data not linked to you: identifiers, usage data, and diagnostics (only collected if you directly use the service,
specifics found in Data Usages by Service).

# Data Usages by Service

We've included a description of both internal (used directly by the application) and external (an outside service) data
collection methods used by each service on rakerman.com.

manner.
