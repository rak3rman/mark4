Hello there! I'm Radison, a software engineer with a knack for leadership, web + networking technologies, photography,
and athletic events. My interest in digital technology started back in middle school when I tinkered with
microcontrollers and competed in FIRST LEGO League competitions — it turns out you can learn a lot from bits of plastic
and expensive servos.

I've worked across industries including commercial clean energy, spacecraft manufacturing, consulting, university administration, political campaigns, enterprise security systems, film + television production, and athletic special events. Through each experience, I've proven I can adapt quickly to new challenges, be industry agnostic, and deliver exceptional software.

Nowadays, I lead all software engineering efforts at [Vista Power](https://vistapower.com). We deliver clean energy as a service for commercial, industrial, and municipal facilities at low or no upfront cost, powered by safe, modular, and cost-effective solar power and battery energy storage. We're moving incredibly fast and dangerously talent-dense (entire leadership team is ex-SpaceX).

In 2024, I graduated from the [University of Illinois Chicago](https://uic.edu) with a degree in Computer Science and Business. During my time at UIC, I project-managed and worked directly with
8+ software developers under the College of Engineering. Together we developed and shipped over 10 full-stack web
applications used by 1000s on campus. I was also a member of the UIC SAE Formula E team.

In 2023, I was a Software Engineering Intern on the
[Starship Software](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/) team at [SpaceX](https://spacex.com)! I demonstrated
leadership and technical excellence by owning a critical flight reliability
tool used to validate over 1,000,000 spacecraft configuration values.

Making an impact is part of my DNA, especially with personal projects. I've given [3 distinct
guest lectures at UIC and 1 lecture internally at SpaceX](/publications) about
[Exploding Chickens](https://chickens.rakerman.com) — a popular web-based card game I built with my friends during COVID-19 (with over 1,500 games played!). We dove deep into project management, design patterns, test coverage, browser architecture, and software engineering basics.

Exploding Chickens fanned the flames (literally) and acted as a springboard for both my professional skills and future
projects. I now lead [Radical Platforms](https://radicalplatforms.org), a small group of highly motivated
software engineers, project managers, and creatives developing Radial — a new form of athletic events operations software. We are working to release the first product (of three) in early 2025.

In my spare time, I love to build things with my hands (woodworking, small electronics), volunteer in
the community (UIC Cities Project, Stanford's Code in Place), and compete in endurance multisport events. In 2022, I
finished [214th](https://www.athlinks.com/event/30585/results/Event/1019369/Course/2251422/Bib/3435) out of 2,456 in the
Chicago Triathlon, Olympic distance — my first multisport race.
