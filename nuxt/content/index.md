I rapidly develop high-quality web utilities that perform at scale. Currently,
I'm studying Computer Science + Business @ [UIC](https://uic.edu), leading an
open-source software team of 8+, and mentoring CPS students on behalf of the
[UIC Cities Project](https://thecitiesproject.org).

Hello there! I’m Radison, a software engineer with a knack for leadership, web + networking technologies, photography,
and multisport events. My interest in digital technology started back in middle school when I tinkered with
microcontrollers and competed in FIRST LEGO League competitions — it turns out you can learn a lot from bits of plastic
and expensive servos.

Fast-forward to today, where I’ve had the privilege of working across a wide gamut of industries including spacecraft
manufacturing, consulting, university administration, political campaigns, enterprise security systems, and athletic
special events. Just this past summer, I was a Software Engineering Intern on the
[Starship Software](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/) team at [SpaceX](https://spacex.com)! I demonstrated
leadership and technical excellence by owning a critical flight reliability
tool used to validate over 1,000,000 spacecraft configuration values.

I’m juggling quite a few responsibilities at the [University of Illinois Chicago](https://uic.edu). For starters, I am
studying computer science and business full-time (with a 3.97 GPA, whoop!). I also project manage and work directly with
8+ software developers under the College of Engineering. Together we've developed and shipped over 10 full-stack web
applications used by 1000's on campus.

Making an impact is part of my DNA, especially when it comes to personal projects. I recently gave [three distinct
guest lectures at UIC and one lecture internally at SpaceX](/publications) about
[Exploding Chickens](https://chickens.rakerman.com) — a popular web-based card game I built with my friends in the era
of COVID-19 (with nearly 1,500 games played!). We dove deep into project management, design patterns, test coverage, web
browser architecture, and software engineering basics.

Exploding Chickens fanned the flames (literally) and acted as a springboard for both my professional skills and further
projects down the line. I now lead [Radical](https://github.com/radicalplatforms), a small group of highly-motivated
software engineers, project managers, and creatives developing open-source web applications. We pursue our personal
passions at scale by leveraging collective intelligence.

In my spare time, I love to build things with my hands (UIC SAE Formula E, woodworking, small electronics), volunteer in
the community (UIC Cities Project, Stanford's Code in Place), and compete in endurance triathlons. In August 2022, I
finished [214th](https://www.athlinks.com/event/30585/results/Event/1019369/Course/2251422/Bib/3435) out of 2,456 in the
Chicago Triathlon, Olympic distance — my first ever multisport race.
