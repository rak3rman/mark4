Hello there! I’m Radison, a software engineer with a knack for leadership, web + networking technologies, photography,
and athletic events. My interest in digital technology started back in middle school when I tinkered with
microcontrollers and competed in FIRST LEGO League competitions — it turns out you can learn a lot from bits of plastic
and expensive servos.

Fast-forward to today, where I’ve had the privilege of working across a wide gamut of industries including: commercial clean energy, spacecraft
manufacturing, consulting, university administration, political campaigns, enterprise security systems, film + television production, and athletic
special events. Through each experience, I've proven that I can adapt quickly to new challenges and deliver exceptional software.

In 2024, I graduated from the [University of Illinois Chicago](https://uic.edu) with a degree in Computer Science and Business. During my time at UIC, I project managed and worked directly with
8+ software developers under the College of Engineering. Together we developed and shipped over 10 full-stack web
applications used by 1000's on campus. I was also a member of the UIC SAE Formula E team acting as a software advisor.

In 2023, I was a Software Engineering Intern on the
[Starship Software](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/) team at [SpaceX](https://spacex.com)! I demonstrated
leadership and technical excellence by owning a critical flight reliability
tool used to validate over 1,000,000 spacecraft configuration values.

Making an impact is part of my DNA, especially when it comes to personal projects. I've given [3 distinct
guest lectures at UIC and 1 lecture internally at SpaceX](/publications) about
[Exploding Chickens](https://chickens.rakerman.com) — a popular web-based card game I built with my friends in the era
of COVID-19 (with nearly 1,500 games played!). We dove deep into project management, design patterns, test coverage, web
browser architecture, and software engineering basics.

Exploding Chickens fanned the flames (literally) and acted as a springboard for both my professional skills and further
projects down the line. I now lead [Radical Platforms](https://radicalplatforms.org), a small group of highly-motivated
software engineers, project managers, and creatives developing Radial — a new form of athletic events operations software. We are working at breakneck speed to release the first product (of three) in early 2025.

In my spare time, I love to build things with my hands (woodworking, small electronics), volunteer in
the community (UIC Cities Project, Stanford's Code in Place), and compete in endurance multisport events. In 2022, I
finished [214th](https://www.athlinks.com/event/30585/results/Event/1019369/Course/2251422/Bib/3435) out of 2,456 in the
Chicago Triathlon, Olympic distance — my first ever multisport race.
