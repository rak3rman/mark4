I rapidly develop high-quality web utilities that perform at scale. Currently,
I'm studying Computer Science + Business @ [UIC](https://uic.edu), leading an
open-source software team of 8+, and mentoring CPS students on behalf of the
[UIC Cities Project](https://thecitiesproject.org).

Hello there! I’m Radison, a software engineer with a knack for leadership, web + networking technologies, photography,
and multisport events. My interest in digital technology started back in middle school when I tinkered with
microcontrollers and competed in FIRST LEGO League competitions — it turns out you can learn a lot from bits of plastic
and expensive servos.

Fast-forward to today, where I’ve had the privilege of working at [a spacecraft manufacturer](https://spacex.com),
[an R1 research university](https://uic.edu), a U.S. Senate campaign, [a start-up](https://www.monteltech.com),
and [an event management group](https://my.lifetime.life/athletic-events.html). Just this past summer, I was a Software
Engineering Intern on the [Starship Software](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/) team at
[SpaceX](https://spacex.com)! I demonstrated leadership and technical excellence by owning a critical flight reliability
tool used to validate over one million vehicle configuration values.

I’m juggling quite a few responsibilities at the [University of Illinois Chicago](https://uic.edu). For starters, I am
studying computer science and business full-time (with a 3.96 GPA, whoop!). I also project manage and work directly with
8+ software developers under the College of Engineering. Together we've developed and shipped over 10 full-stack web
applications used by 1000's on campus.

Making an impact is part of my DNA, especially when it comes to personal projects. I recently gave [three distinct
300-level guest lectures at UIC and one lecture internally at SpaceX](/publications) about
[Exploding Chickens](https://chickens.rakerman.com) — a popular web-based card game I built with my friends in the era
of COVID-19. We dove deep into project management, design patterns, code review, and test coverage.

Exploding Chickens fanned the flames (literally) and acted as a springboard for both my professional skills and further
projects down the line. I now lead [Radical](https://github.com/radicalplatforms), a group of highly-motivated software
engineers, project managers, and creatives developing open-source web applications.

In my spare time, I love to build things with my hands (SAE Formula E, woodworking, small electronics), volunteer in the
community (UIC Cities Project), and compete in endurance triathlons. In August 2022, I finished
[214th](https://www.athlinks.com/event/30585/results/Event/1019369/Course/2251422/Bib/3435) out of 2,456 in the Chicago
Triathlon, Olympic distance — my first ever multisport race.
