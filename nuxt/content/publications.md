_Delivered April 27th, 2023 at the University of Illinois Chicago under supervision of Prof. Mark Hallenbeck_

Abstract: Explored the inner workings of Exploding Chickens, an ambitious personal project that expanded into a 30,000+

project, hosted a live open demo of v2, high-level overview of v1 stack/design choices, the MVC (Model-View-Controller)
pattern in action on v1, v1 data schema, v1 websocket architecture (with its pitfalls), v1 code dive, high-level
overview of v2 stack/design choices, v2 test coverage, v2 data schema, v2 code dive, v3 architecture, and v3 cloud
implementation, along with a few key takeaways for better application design.
